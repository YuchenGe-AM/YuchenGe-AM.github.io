    "> E.g. $\\mathbb{R}$ and $S^1$ has the same Lie algebra, but one is compact while one is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Thm.** Every connected manifold $M$ has a special connected covering called the **universal covering** $ \\tilde{M}$. The universal covering is characterized by the **simply connected** property.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof.** It is defined, given a base point $z \\in M$, as a set of equivalence classes of continuous maps \\( \\gamma : [0,1] \\rightarrow M \\) with \\( \\gamma(0) = z \\). Two such maps \\( \\gamma, \\gamma' \\) are equivalent if they have the same endpoint \\( \\gamma(1) = \\gamma'(1) \\) and there is a continuous family \\( \\gamma_t \\), for \\( t \\in [0,1] \\) fixing the end points and such that \\( \\gamma_0 = \\gamma, \\gamma_1 = \\gamma' \\). The map \\( [\\gamma] \\mapsto \\gamma(1) \\) is a covering map \\( \\pi \\) of manifolds. It is universal in the sense that if \\( p : N \\rightarrow M \\) is any other connected covering then there is a covering map \\( q : \\tilde{M} \\rightarrow N \\) with \\( \\pi = p \\circ q \\). The map \\( q \\) is unique so long as we choose a point \\( x \\in \\tilde{M} \\) and \\( y \\in N \\) mapping to \\( z \\in M \\) and require \\( q(x) = y \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "When \\( G \\) is a Lie group and we take \\( z = e \\), then multiplication of paths \\( \\gamma(t)\\gamma'(t) \\) defines a product on \\( \\tilde{G} \\) and with the identity as the equivalence class of the trivial path \\( \\gamma(t) = e \\), we can define inversion by \\( \\gamma(t)^{-1} \\). Thus \\( \\tilde{G} \\) is a Lie group and the projection \\( \\pi : \\tilde{G} \\rightarrow G \\) a Lie group homomorphism. Moreover given a covering homomorphism \\( p : H \\rightarrow G \\), if we choose \\( x,y,z \\) as previously to be the identity elements in each group, then the unique \\( q : \\tilde{G} \\rightarrow H \\) is a Lie group homomorphism. Thus each covering group is obtained from \\( \\tilde{G} \\) as the quotient group by a subgroup of \\( \\text{Ker} \\pi \\).\n",
