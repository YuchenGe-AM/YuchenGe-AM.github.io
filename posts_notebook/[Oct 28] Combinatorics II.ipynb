    "\n",
    "**Proof.** For Thm I, The first follows from the greedy algorithm, wheareas the second follows from the definitions of the clique number and independence number. Thm II relies on the following observation ( a direct consequence of the existence of the spanning tree ): **if $G$ is connected graph with $n$ vertices $v \\in V(G)$. Then we may order the vertices as $v_1, \\dots, v_{n-1}, v_n = v$ so that each vertex other than $v$ has at least one neighbour coming after it**.\n",

Then $\\chi(G) \\leq d$. Since **a connected graph with maximum degree $d$ that contains $K_{d+1}$ must be $K_{d+1}$**, this restatement applied with $d = \\Delta(G)$ implies the theorem. We prove the restated result by induction on $n = |G|$. \n",

    "Specifically, we discuss through the cutvertex. If some cutvertex exists, induction applies. If there esists no cutvertex, we can find neighbours $x$ and $y$ of $v$ s.t. $xy \\notin E(G)$. ( Here we assume there esixt some vertex $v$ with degree $d$, since otherwise we may apply Thm I. ) After that, we discuss if $G − x − y$ is connected. If connected, then we may prove by ordering the vertices. If not, we prove by partitioning $V(G)-\\{x,y\\}$ and then do some induction."
