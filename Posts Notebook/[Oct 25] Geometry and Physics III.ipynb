In other words, the one parameter group $\\varphi_t$ defined by $X$ preserves the vector field $Y$.

Since $gxh = g(xh)$, left and right actions commute. So the one-parameter group $\\varphi_t$ commutes with all left translations, which follows that the vector field obtained by differentiation with respect to $t$ at $t = 0$ is left-invariant. For another direction, simply define $ \\gamma(t) = \\sigma_t(e)$.\n",
