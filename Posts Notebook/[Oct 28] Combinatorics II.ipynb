Thm II relies on the following observation ( a direct consequence of the existence of the spanning tree ): **if $G$ is connected graph with $n$ vertices $v \\in V(G)$. Then we may order the vertices as $v_1, \\dots, v_{n-1}, v_n = v$ so that each vertex other than $v$ has at least one neighbour coming after it**.\n",

Then $\\chi(G) \\leq d$. Since **a connected graph with maximum degree $d$ that contains $K_{d+1}$ must be $K_{d+1}$**, this restatement applied with $d = \\Delta(G)$ implies the theorem. We prove the restated result by induction on $n = |G|$. \n",

    "Specifically, we discuss through the cutvertex. If some cutvertex exists, induction applies. If there esists no cutvertex, we can find neighbours $x$ and $y$ of $v$ s.t. $xy \\notin E(G)$. ( Here we assume there esixt some vertex $v$ with degree $d$, since otherwise we may apply Thm I. ) After that, we discuss if $G − x − y$ is connected. If connected, then we may prove by ordering the vertices. If not, we prove by partitioning $V(G)-\\{x,y\\}$ and then do some induction."
